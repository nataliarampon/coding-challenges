# Folder Structure
Each folder inside the `leetcode` folder contains a solution for one coding exercise and is named as follows "`<leetcode_number>`-`<problem_summary>`".

For example, for Leetcode's exercise number #1480, entitled "Running Sum of 1d Array", the exercise folder would be named `1480-running-sum-of-1d-array.`

## Subfolder Structure
Inside each coding exercise folder, there is one subfolder for each programming language in which this exercise has been solved.

The language names are standardized as follows:
- `c++`
- `go` (shorthand for Golang)
- `js` (shorthand for JavaScript)
- `py` (shorthand for Python)
- `ts` (shorthand for TypeScript)
