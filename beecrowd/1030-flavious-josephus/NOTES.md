## Josephus problem

This is a classical counting-out problem in computer science ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem)). Here the problem is the general one, with arbitrary n and k. We can model it using recurrence or dynamic programming, although I resolved it using an iterative algorithm.
