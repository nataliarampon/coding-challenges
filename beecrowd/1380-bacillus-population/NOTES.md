## Pisano Period
The [Pisano Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisano_period) (`pi(n)`) is the the period with which the Fibonacci sequence taken modulo `n` repeats itself. In this problem, we use the Pisano Period of `n = 1000`, since we only want the last 3 digits of the Fibonacci sequence. According to OEIS [A096363](https://oeis.org/A096363), `pi(1000) = 1500`. Although there isn't a direct way of calculating the Pisano Period, there luckily is a property that for getting the last `d` digits where `d >= 3`, the Pisano Period of `10^d` is `15*10^(d-1)`.

## Reading Large Int Modulo in Python
Another challenge with this problem here is the size of the maximum input: `10^1000000`. Using the common `int(str)` way of transforming a string to integer in Python would take too long with such a long number. Here we make use of the Pisano Period: we simply take the modulo 1500 of the input, as the last 3 digits we want are going to repeat. We transform the string in decimal already taking the `mod(1500)` of each digit, in this way, we don't need to make operations with huge integers, which would lead to a time limit error. This can be done because in [modular arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic), for a `mod(k)`, `a%k + b%k == (a + b)%k`.
