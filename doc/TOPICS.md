# Topics

In order to facilitate the study of topics on a need-to-know basis, the coding exercises related to each topic are listed below. Some exercises cover more than one topic and thus may appear in more than one list. Each problem has its difficulty specified as shown on Leetcode. 

## Arrays
Arrays are a data structure consisting of a list of ordered elements. Each element may be identified by an array index, which denotes its position inside the array. Array indexes normally start at `0` and end at `n-1` (`n` being the array length). [Arrays on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure).

Coding exercises involving arrays:
- [724](../leetcode/724-find-pivot-index/): Find pivot index (`easy`)
- [1480](../leetcode/1480-running-sum-of-1d-array/): Running sum of 1D array (`easy`)

## Prefix Sum
The prefix sum, also known as the cumulative sum, is a sequence of numbers `y` as such that each element of the sequence is the running total of the elements from another sequence `x`. That is, `y0 = x0` ; `y1 = x0 + x1` ; `y2 = x0 + x1 + x2`.
